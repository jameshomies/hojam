    <h1>Subramanian Research Group</h1>
    <h2>Winter 2021-Current</h2>

<br><br>
<p>In the Subramanian Research Group, we focus on solid-state synthesis for the purpose of creating novel inorganic
  solid-state functional materials. These materials of interest can be used and are characterized for their properties
  in electronics, conducitivty, magnetic potential, dielectric and thermoelectric, and high performance color pigments.
  Dr. Mas Subramanian is Milton Harris Chair of Material Science and the PI at the time the novel blue pigment, known as YInMn Blue or Oregon Blue, first surfaced from his labortaory. Since then, pigments and their performance has
  been a notable emphasis in the Subramanian Research Group. </p>

<p>In inorganic chemistry, we make use of the transition metals shown on the periodic table. When it comes to synthesis
  using these metals, it is pertinent to have the theory behind the bonding that comes in consideration for metals. Most
  transition metals have several oxidation states and depending on these oxidation states, affects the number of valence
  electrons, thus affecting their low-high spin complex when they bond. It is the arrangement of electrons and their
  differing energy level in metals that rises to certain properties like ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism and
  color. It is important to know that each metal has its own unique properties, from conductivity, toxicity, and
  oxidation sensitivity that gives these synthesized metals their own characterisics. We aim to utilize the transition
  metals and their unique properties to design material that best incorporates them into real-world application </p>
<br>
<p> in this group, I assist a graduate student on their project of creating novel double perovskites for properties
  characterization. Perovskties have a general formula ABX3, and have the same type of crystal structure of calcium
  titanate oxide (CaTiO3). A double pervoskite has a structure when half of the "B" site cations of the structure is
  replaced by another "B" cation, so would have the structure A2BB'X6. In this project, we replace certain coordinated
  atoms of a previously researched double pervoskite with more economical and less hazardous chemicals for their
  characterization.  </p>

 <h1>Structure-Property Relationship of Various Nonstoichiometric Solid Solutions </h1>
 <br><br><p>
 The goal of this project is to synthesize solid solutions of nonstoichiometric compounds using traditional solid-state synthesis techniques. Characterization data is collected for various solid solutions to better understand the structure-property relationships through various compositions. Using the generic formula ABO3, I substitute an oxidized metal of the B-site and charge compensate it with a metal ion of different oxidation. In this project, I synthesize several perovskites with different percent compositions. 
 I then prep and run the powders for X-ray diffraction data. From there, I press the samples into pellets and prepare them for dielectric data. Since varying the composition content affected color, I would run a colorimeter to analyze for light absorbance. Magnetic properties are the last thing I test for a full characterization profile of these materials.

 <h1>Double Perovsktites with Enhanced Thermoelectric Properties</h1>
 <br><br>
<p>By synthesizing a variety of double perovskites that have the formula A2B2O6, our goal is to have a layered perovskites (obtaining the double perovskite structure) with enhanced thermoelectric properties. The study is based on synthesizing La2MM'O6 compounds where M and M' are 3+ transition metal cations. My role is to synthesize the series double perovskites and test both traditional solid state synthesis and nitrate synthesis techniques. Once synthesized, I prep the powders and run them through an X-Ray diffractometer to ensure phase purity. From there, I press the powders into a pellet, polish them, and make sure they are electrically insulating via voltmeter. I then run them through dielectric measurements at an increasing temperature to determine its dielectric constant. I compare the thermoelectric properties and help plot the data against the other perovskites for comparison.</p>
