                  <h1>What is Supplemental Instructions?</h1>
                  <p>Supplemental Instructions is an internationally recognized academic support program. It is a non-traditional form of
                    tutoring that focuses on collarboration of historically challenging courses. It is a peer-led study group that focuses
                    on understanding key course concepts in a supportive, interactive learning environment. 
                    <br> <br>
                    I am an SI leader for General Chemistry. I have experience teaching this course as a General Chemistry Teaching
                    Assistant and tutor. I also have experience working with small groups, from leading labs and review sessions, to being a
                    mentor for dozens of students in the dorms as a Resident Assistant. I have experience in pedagogy techniques with
                    students as a prior Learning Assistant in Calculus. </p>

                    <p>SI Tables meet every week for fifty minutes. During this time, there will be a structured plan for the day devised by
                      the SI leader. These tables are active, and the structure or activities often fluctute week-by-week to better fit the
                      needs of each individual group. 
                      <br><br>
                    I will be the SI Leader supporting General Chemistry this year. During each term, it is expected that I host 5
                      different study tables, each with about 10 students. Keep in mind that with over 1300 students taking general
                      chemistry each year, spots are competitive. If you would like to register or learn more about SI, click on the
                      following links to the side. Below you will find previous SI worksheets, answer keys, and solutions videos for each
                      week. In addition, for those of you who are taking SI with me currently, please fill out the weekly survey posted at the end of every study tables.</p>
