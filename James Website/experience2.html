                          <p> Originally, I was a resident at Cauthorn hall during my freshman year. I had the opportunity to become the youngest Resident Assistant by being an RA at the ILLC for the summer term of 2020. I later went on to Hawley/Buxton, the engineering dorm, to
                              be the Resident Assistant for the 2020-2021 academic year before returning to the ILLC the following summer. This upcoming
                              academic year, I will be the RA in Sackett Hall, which is one of the Honors College Dorms. In my culmination of within
                              residential education, I will have worked with over five hundred students in the dormitories where I offer resources for
                              incoming college student, facillitate safe and encouraging academic learning envrionments, host community events,
                              put up bulletin boards, and deal with crisis management situations. During my time as an RA, I have personally led and instructed residents in chemistry class by making worksheets and hosting group study sessions. During my first year in Residential Education, I was awarded the end of the year Dianne Finklein Memorial Scholarhip. </p>

                                    <p> My sophomore year, I was the youngest teaching assistant for the general chemistry 23x series as well as the lab 26x
                                        components. I participated in lectures and assisted students in need of help with general chemistry. I independently
                                        taught the lab sections, totaling 80 students and held office hours via the Mole Hole every week. I attended weekly staff meetings for the chemistry lecture as well as the lab along the graduate students to better prepare students the following week. In addition, I
                                        wrote review sheets and other study material for students, as well as hosted review session within my dorm with my
                                        residents. I am hoping to continue on teaching general chemistry but I am excited about the possibility of becoming
                                        a teaching assistant for organic chemistry, either in this capacity or as a Supplemental Instructions Leader. Check

Additionally, we packed rooms for Scholar Housing arrivals, attended to their needs and answered questions.
