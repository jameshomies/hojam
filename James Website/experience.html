                        <p> Originally, I was a resident at Cauthorn hall during my freshman year. I had the opportunity to become the youngest resident assistant by being an RA at the ILLC for the summer term of 2020. I later went on to Hawley/Buxton, the engineering dorm, to
                            be the resident assistant for the 2020-2021 academic year before returning to the ILLC the following summer. This upcoming
                            academic year, I will be the RA in Sackett Hall, which is one of the Honors College Dorms. In my culmination of within
                            residential education, I will have worked with over five hundred students in the dormitories where I offer resources for
                            incoming college student, facillitate safe and encouraging academic learning envrionments, host community events,
                            put up bulletin boards, and deal with crisis management situations. During my time as an RA, I have personally led and instructed residents in chemistry class by making worksheets and hosting group study sessions.  </p>

                                     <p> I was the youngest teaching assistant for the general chemistry 23x series as well as the lab 26x components. I participated in lectures and assisted students in need of help with general chemistry. I independently taught the lab sections, totaling 80 students and held office hours via the Mole Hole every week. In addition, I wrote review sheets and other study material for students, as well as hosted review session within my dorm with my residents. I am hoping to continue on teaching general chemistry but I am excited aabout the possibility of becoming a teaching assistant for organic chemistry, either in this capacity or as a Supplemental Instructions Leader.Check out some of the chemistry content I have made in the past above in the "Chemistry Resources" tab.  </p>

                                                <p> I have been in the Subramanian research group with Dr. Mas Subramanian in his solid-state materials lab since Winter 2021. In this lab, I assist in the creation of novel perovskites for characterization and properties. I work alongside a graduate student and assist their project by creating samples, preparing them for characterization, and running tests. See my research page above for more

                                                    naturally occuring peptides and organic ligands to create these frameworks for separation large compounds on the basis of size, and later,
                                                on the basis of enantiomeric selectivity in racemic mixtures. Check out my research page for more info!
