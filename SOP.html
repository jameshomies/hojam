                 <h1>Statement of Purpose</h1>
                 <p><i> Note: With the entire culmination of
                      one's life experience, it is difficult to confine one's goals and ambitions 
                   in a single page. In this essay, I hope to convey the force that galvanizes my motives.</i>
                   
                   <br><br> When I beat homelessness during my first year in college, I found that my fervor for education skyrocketed. Although difficult, I learned to appreciate the hard work of navigating a worldwide pandemic alone, tutoring students for free meals, scavenging Wi-Fi spots to attend virtual classes, and late-night scholarship hunting to earn the luxury of a higher education as a first-generation college student. From the resolve instilled to self-fund my way through college, I promised myself I would never take my chemical engineering education for granted. Instead, I would take every opportunity to explore my interests as much as possible during my undergraduate program.
 
                   <br><br> Growing up in one of the most polluted and energy expensive cities in the states, I was made pointedly aware that it is how we utilized green chemistry that determined the trajectory of the fossil fuel and energy crisis. Understanding how macroscopic phenomena related to the microscopic underpinnings of chemical theory and mechanics piqued my interest since researching with Dr. Kyriakos Stylianou the designability and applications of nanoporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in the Materials and Discovery Lab (MaD Lab). There, I realized many observed phenomena in experimental chemistry cannot be faithfully explained without its physical interpretation grounded in reaction engineering and transport mechanics. While testing MOFs for standard catalysis, I wondered to what extent intermediates diffuse through the solution and how charge and mass transport impact MOFs or other complex heterogeneous catalysts? It dawned on me that their inherent structural complexity precluded any feasible model for such reactions at the current moment. At Stanford University, I intend to integrate aspects of transport phenomena and nanoarchitecture to better understand how to design catalytic materials for sustainable energy access.
                    
                     
                   <br><br> The research that professor Cargnello oversees on nanomaterials well suits my interests. Particularly, the emphasis on selectively shaping the architecture of nanomaterials to observe changes in catalytic activity for environmental applications is something I can see myself committing to. For example, I would love to investigate the design of heterogeneous catalysts and understand how their molecular assemblies impact kinetic and diffusion profiles for reaction systems converting carbon dioxide into value-added products. I recognize reliance on reutilizing greenhouse gasses as energy sources is not foundationally sustainable; the field of photocatalysis, on the other hand, is booming. Accordingly, I am curious how the dielectric properties of photovoltaic cells can be tuned through thoughtful placement of nanoparticles to promote water splitting. Using MOFs or other porous organic frameworks as supports for bimetallic nanoparticles is my first intuition and something I would want to first try exploring. Relevant coursework at Stanford such as Principles and Practice of Heterogeneous Catalysis will guide some 
                    of my inquiries but more so, the insights the Cargnello group offers based on their practical experience in rational catalyst design and nanotechnology will be invaluable to the research questions I hope to cultivate.
                     
                    <br><br> At Oregon State University, I joined three interdisciplinary materials research groups, each honing my foundation in materials design and application and preparing me for this environment. I was first introduced to such when I joined Dr. Mas Subramanian's solid-state research group where I synthesized various perovskite solid solutions of nonstoichiometric compounds using traditional solid-state synthesis techniques and charge compensating them with different metal ions. I performed diffraction, optical, magnetic, and dielectric characterization to elucidate their structure-property relationship with the product being a perovskite with elevated thermoelectric properties. More fascinated with material electrical properties, I joined Dr. David Cann’s Electroceramics Group where I worked in collaboration with an international electronics company to design a new capacitor suitable for cell phones. I learned to synthesize and characterize ceramic composites for grain size, low-temperature dielectric measurements, and polarization vs electric field measurements. One such ceramic I synthesized displayed a sufficiently high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss to be further investigated and renewed grant funding for the project from the company.
                    
                    <br><br>Graduate courses such as Selected Topics in Inorganic Chemistry formally introduced me to porous materials but more importantly, exposed me to the literature to observe how other researchers exploit structural functionalities for applications such as photocatalysis and carbon dioxide sequestration. While my previous projects interested me, I am reminded that I want to culminate the knowledge I obtained in materials design for a humanitarian cause. This past year in the MaD Lab, I led two projects for carbon dioxide recycling to value-added products. The first demonstrates a ruthenium-based MOF catalyst with superior performance to isostructural analogues of it and earned a first author publication. The second work I currently lead investigates colloids and harnesses encapsulated metal nanoparticles in MOF structures to catalyze methanol synthesis from carbon dioxide to reduce plastic pollution in situ.
                    
                    <br><br> When I lost my home due to the pandemic, I almost had to end my college career. Today, my undergraduate program is coming to a close, but on my terms, as I look to continue research in graduate school. Interestingly, I dedicate my prospects to this pandemic which sparked a determination in exploring what is important to me. After facing that reality, I could never be satisfied with simply doing the bare minimum in college as I sought more opportunities through research, teaching, mentoring, and serving as an example to other students that even the most daunting of obstacles can be short stepping stones on the path towards scientific discovery. For me, this philosophy has granted me complete autonomy over my situation today and serves as a reminder that with hard work, I have the ability to succeed in my goals; with motivation, I am resolute. I am excited for the advent of an even higher education where I can inquire about more scientific questions and tackle more challenges in research– both plentiful at Stanford. With my experience and education, I intend to proceed in academia as a professor mentoring students and start my own materials discovery laboratory for sustainable energy. I know the environment at Stanford will be challenging, but with their opportunities and some dedicated hard work, I will continue to succeed in my goals.
