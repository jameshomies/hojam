                 <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
                 <p><i> Note: Written for the 2023 NSF Graduate Research Fellowship .</i>
                   
                   <br><br><b>Introduction and Background:</b> I had two hundred dollars and enough vision when I first came to Oregon to get an engineering education. My parents, immigrant nail salon workers, never had the opportunity to finish high school and could not financially support higher education for me. While stressful, I could relish the satisfaction brought by working for a first-generation education: catering sandwiches full-time, back-and-forths with financial aid officers, and traveling daily to Linn Benton Community College (LBCC). However, I was later left homeless on the streets of my campus during the 2019 pandemic and faced financial registration holds that would bar me from continuing college. I was furious, hysteric, and disappointed. I had given up so much to attend a college, but perhaps I was disappointed at this supposed “end” to higher education because I felt unfulfilled with my experience.
                   <br><br>Suddenly, a degree was not enough anymore. After months of work, I found a stable residence and funded my entire college education with scholarships I had won. I dual-enrolled with Oregon State University (OSU) to further explore my interests, leading me to teaching and materials research. Moreso, I could see education as an opportunity rather than a means to an end. My experience, while humbling, is a reminder that with the privilege to receive an education, I have an opportunity to address educational inequities and benefit society. Thus, chemical engineering is an opportunity for me to wield my curiosity for the “science of change” to make a positive difference in the world as a scientist and educator. Herein, I describe how my opportunities taken in research, teaching, and outreach at OSU will emanate during my Ph.D. at Northwestern University and help me to succeed as a researcher, mentor, and future professor.
                    <br><br><b>Intellectual Merits:</b> I first began researching materials design in 2021 my sophomore year at OSU in the Subramanian Group under Professor Mas Subramanian to study perovskite electronics. While they are the most photoactive solar cells, lead-containing perovskites pose as potential carcinogens. With this in mind, my goal was to study the structure-property relationships of cation-substituted ABO3 perovskites and A2(BB’)O6 double perovskites toward designing new high-performance lead-free semi-conductor materials. I performed solid-state synthesis, charge-compensating oxidized B-site metals with different transition metals to create perovskites of different electronic structures. I learned how to characterize diffraction, dielectric, and absorbance properties at varying non-stoichiometric charge occupancies and temperatures. With my findings, I could create thermoelectric structure-property relationships that were essential to my graduate student mentor’s Ph.D. dissertation defense, who passed and graduated this past summer. Our findings on novel perovskite structures with enhanced thermoelectric properties at elevated temperatures are currently being drafted for publication where I will be second author. 	
                    <br><br>	At the time, I was also interested in the reverse case for tuning perovskite’s thermoelectric properties–how can a material be made with favorable electrical properties at lower temperatures? I joined Professor David Cann’s Electroceramics Group at OSU during my junior year in 2021 under a year-long collaboration with an international electronics company to create a temperature-ranging ceramic capacitor to be used in cell phones. Using the solid-state synthesis techniques I had learned from the Subramanian Group, I made lanthanide-based ceramic perovskites at non-stoichiometric occupancies to elucidate their low-temperature dielectric properties. In both groups, I honed my crystallography skills and understanding of how structure affected electronic properties. At the end of the year, I learned how to communicate my research to our industry collaborators, presenting on a perovskite I had made with high capacitance and low dielectric loss to be further studied and renewed our group funding for another year.	
                    <br><br>  While only an Oregonian for a few years, witnessing first-hand the rise in forest wildfires and the recession of beautiful natural glaciers along the Cascade Range over the years motivated me to utilize my materials research to help combat climate change. I took graduate courses in inorganic chemistry and heterogenous catalysis which exposed me to how porous materials are being used for CO2 upcycling. This inspired me to join a third lab, the Materials Discovery Lab (MaD Lab) in 2021 under OSU professor Kyriakos Stylianou, to independently research metal-organic framework (MOFs) catalysts for CO2 fixation onto epoxides to create greener, value-added products. I recognized that ruthenium-MOFs had not been previously studied for this application and that I could expand research on them. I hypothesized that ruthenium’s higher oxidation state compared to other transition metals would result in a more active catalyst. Over 6 months, I designed the experimental plan and led the catalytic trials, data analysis, and manuscript writing for this project, sharing that ruthenium-MOF metal sites significantly improved CO2 transformation compared to an isostructural MOF of a different metal. In 2022, my efforts investigating a new, highly active catalyst to upcycle CO2 were rewarded when I received my first undergraduate publication as first-author in a top catalysis journal, Catalysis Science and Technology.
                    <br><br>I also spearheaded research utilizing MOFs for enantiomer separations, which is crucial for safe drug administration. To understand how MOFs can be tuned for this application, I synthesized 5 novel isoreticular homochiral MOFs to research their structure-property relationship between pore size and enantioselective DL-Penicillamine separation. This project was almost abandoned because of our inability to access chiral chromatography to quantify enantioselectivity, but I developed a protocol with circular dichroism calibrations to measure the optical activity of enantiomer mixtures. I could relate this activity to quantify enantioselective adsorption, showing a volcano-plot relationship between drug selectivity and pore size, and provide an optimal MOF pore size towards drug separation. I have presented this work at regional and national American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) conferences, accumulating 3 poster and oral presentations, and completed my undergraduate Honors Thesis under this project. In 2023, I submitted my second undergraduate first-author publication, currently under revision to the Chemistry of Materials. To expand on these novel MOF’s enantioselective applications, the summer after graduation, I probed these materials' homochiral and Lewis acid character towards reticular asymmetric catalysis of epoxides. I am now collaborating on the project with a graduate student at OSU while at NU.  
                    <br><br> Four years ago, I was homeless and nearly forced to drop out of community college. I have since worked towards overcoming the odds, working 40+ hours a week to support myself financially whilst balancing research and a full-time course load. Today, with my determination, I have graduated magna cum laude with an Honors B.S. in chemical engineering from OSU with over ten institutional academic scholarships and national research honors such as the NSF GRFP Honorable Mention and Goldwater Scholarship Honorable Mention. My collective research experiences helped me understand that more fundamental questions in catalysis must be answered to tackle global sustainability problems. These questions have brought me to Northwestern University (NU), a world leader in chemical and material engineering research, where I can utilize their Reactor Engineering and Catalyst Testing (REACT) facility under the Catalysis and Surface Science Center and the NU Atomic and Nanoscale Characterization Experimental (NUANCE) center to help design experiments that can guide solutions to these problems. Specifically, I can work with Professor Dayne Swearer at NU to design catalysts that utilize CO2 to sustainably produce fuels and learn how to disseminate my research under the 10-week Research Communication Training Program, helping me facilitate collaborative networks to tackle these problems in a global context.
                    <br><br><b>Broader Impacts:</b> When I lost my housing due to the 2019 pandemic, I sat outside the curb of a then-vacant engineering dorm. When I thought my dreams of becoming an engineer were over, my Resident Assistant (Zach) sat beside me and said, “How can I help.” He patiently showed me the resources I needed to get back on my feet. He was a leader who simply wanted to serve his community. With the help of him, advisors, professors, and social workers, I could finance my degree and take advantage of the educational opportunities offered to me. These memories serve as a lesson in humility and as a personal mandate to reduce barriers to education and opportunities in STEM as I continue my academic journey.
                    <br><br>In 2020, the year following, I became the same engineering dorm's Resident Assistant (RA). As an RA, I led social justice education dialogues and promoted opportunities such as industry outreach, engineering clubs, undergraduate research, and organizations that improve the visibility of STEM minorities. Virtually all engineering majors require chemistry, a challenging subject for freshmen exacerbated by remote learning. Seeing this, I volunteer-tutored students in the dorms and tailored worksheets for weekly group chemistry workshops over Zoom. I also created a chemistry community on Discord and a personal teaching website for residents. Over 3 years, I worked in 6 dorms with diverse living-learning communities ranging from engineering, Honors College (HC), international, and athletes to promote chemistry tutoring and social and STEM events. In 2021, I received the Dianne Finklein Memorial Scholarship, an award issued to one RA each year by OSU Residential Education for my outreach, contribution to social justice education, and academic development across the dorms. 
                    <br><br>During my undergraduate, I took every opportunity to teach. To expand my outreach, I partnered with the HC in 2021 and pioneered the official HC chemistry tutor role, allowing me to connect with advisors and professors and advertise my free resources across OSU. Over three years, I have led studios, held office hours, independently instructed labs, and lectured in front of classrooms for 22 core chemical engineering classrooms as a Teaching/Learning assistant. When my Fluid Mechanics professor went on maternity leave my senior year, I had the opportunity to co-instruct the remaining half of the course to lecture on Navier-Stokes Equations and computational fluids software for a trailer class of 10 students. By graduation, I was honored to learn that I was named the recipient of the 2023 ChE Erik Muehlenkamp Memorial Leadership Award for my commitment to undergraduate education in chemical engineering. These experiences helped me realize that I want to advance my pedagogy as a graduate student and as a future professor. The NSF GRFP will help me secure a place in the Teaching Apprenticeship Program at NU. This program selects 2-3 students each year, and under this program, I will collaborate with a professor to co-teach and design curriculum for a chemical engineering class, preparing me for academia. 
                    <br><br>As I have overcome adversity to reap the privilege that is opportunity, I am motivated to promote underserved youth experiences in STEM. During my senior year, I traveled to half a dozen low-economic K-12 schools throughout Oregon to outreach Engineering and Science Nights to thousands of kids and helped host STEM outreach events at OSU. Here, I developed activities in creating gel beads, combining art and chemistry with thin-layer chromatography, and having hands-on fun with non-Newtonian fluids such as Oobleck, slime, silly putty, and ketchup. This past summer, I was a camp leader in the Summer Experience in Science and Engineering for Youth, which primarily hosts high school girls to engage in a week-long engineering project under a lab at OSU. During this, I mentored two students on a project I co-design entitled, “Investigation of MOF ZIF-8 Growth/Synthesis and Characterization” and served on a panel to share my experiences navigating college as a low-income, first-generation engineering student. 
                    <br><br>These experiences are only the beginning of my mission to reduce barriers for underrepresented students–I am always learning. In my first quarter at NU, I am taking a “Creating Inclusive STEM” seminar to discuss and understand these barriers. While only one month into my Ph.D. program, I joined the Chemical and Biological Engineering Teaching Committee and Anti-Racism, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee. I can leverage these two organizations by leading discussions towards creating a better STEM learning and teaching environment whilst advocating for the diverse student body needs at NU. I also joined NU’s Science Club where I will travel to the McCormick Boys & Girls Club every week to mentor students at underserved middle schools towards a 7-10 weeklong science curriculum. In collaboration with NUANCE Center and NU’s Science Club, I propose an outreach curriculum that investigates nanoparticle (NP) chemistry. This will be 7 weeks long, and each week can be dedicated to controlling different NP properties such as magnetism, geometry, yield, and quality. This can be done economically by tuning NP synthesis with metals used, light source, capping and reducing agents, stirring rate, and temperature. At the end, they will apply their NPs toward heavy metal capture, present posters, and be asked in a survey if they can more likely see science as a future career. Over 2/3rds of high schools in Illinois do not have a chemistry curriculum—this is more evident in low-economic regions in Chicago. This curriculum aims to help students who may not have access to chemistry curricula recognize that science can be used for real-world applications such as purifying water from Chicago’s lead pipelines.	
                    <br><br><b>Future Goals:</b> Having transitioned from once homeless at a community college and state school to now attending a private graduate university, I can understand the vision of opportunity that is obscured by poverty. This harsh dichotomy is a reminder that with the privilege of an advanced degree, my motivation is to serve. I hope to inspire the next generation of scientists to realize one’s background (low-income, homeless, first-generation, community college) can be steppingstones to becoming scientific leaders.	While challenging, my experiences made me the person I am today and readied me for who I aim to be tomorrow. After finishing my Ph.D. at NU, I hope to continue my research on catalytic materials as a professor at an R1 or R2 university where I will mentor students to tackle societal problems such as global warming and sustainable fuel production. I will also continue my goal of reducing barriers to education and STEM opportunities by practicing inclusive pedagogy in the classroom and by coordinating STEM outreach programs that cater to underrepresented K-12 students (summer camps and afterschool programs), non-research-focused universities, and community colleges (REUs).
                    <br><br>I am excited for the advent of an even higher education where I can inquire about more thought-provoking questions and tackle more challenges that address sustainable energy problems in the world—both abundant in Chemical Engineering. With my experience and education, I intend to proceed in academia as a professor mentoring students and start my own materials discovery laboratory for sustainable energy. With each obstacle and failure I face, I remember every late-night scholarship hunt behind the DutchBros shop that has led me here. The environment at any graduate school will be challenging, but if I may resonate with their scientific profundity, mission values, and contribute some dedicated hard work from myself, I know I will continue to succeed in my goals.
