                 <h1>Statement of Purpose</h1>

                      one's life experience, it is difficult to confine one's goals and ambitions 
                    in a single page. In this essay, I hope to convey the force that galvanize's my motives.</i>
                   
                <br><br>     
                One of the proudest accomplishments in my life was making it to my sophomore year of college. When I first attended college, I never thought that at my best, I would be working fulltime to pay through school without any aid, and at my worst, I would be jobless, homeless and alone amidst a world-wide pandemic. As I moved from coffee shop to coffee shop to attend school while tutoring students for free meals, I witnessed first hand the wave of misinformation regarding COVID-19 that burdened certain communities. After the hardest and most rewarding year of my life, I decided two things about myself moving forward: first, hard work will motivate me to succeed in anything I put my mind to and that I was never going to stand by and idly watch life just “happen” to me again. Second, a higher education is a privilege, and I would take every opportunity to learn and use my chemical engineering education to better our society.
 
                <br><br>Ever since learning about how combustion fuels impact greenhouse gas and energy crises, I have always elected to spend the extra time riding my bike opposed to driving. I was made pointedly aware in college that it was chemistry that could serve as the deal breaker in  the “reduce, reuse, recycle” movement. Understanding how macroscopic phenomena related to the microscopic underpinnings of chemical theory and mechanisms has always piqued my interest. Particularly, how properties of materials such as catalysts can be structurally tuned. I realized the necessity of a graduate degree when I started working in the Materials and Discovery Lab under Dr. Kyriakos Stylianou to research the designability of nanoporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for various applications. Here, I discovered firsthand the limits of experimental chemistry: many observed phenomena cannot be faithfully explained without physical or mathematical interpretation. I started asking questions to understand these limits. While using MOFs as a catalyst to reuse fossil fuels, to what extent do carbon dioxide intermediates diffuse through solution? How do charge and mass transport affect MOFs or other complex heterogeneous catalysts during a reaction? I scoured the literature for the answer to realize that it is inherently difficult to model such materials because of their complex structures. That is why at Stanford university, I intend to study the transport, design and architecture of materials for applications of improving sustainable chemistry.
                 
                <br><br>I know coursework such Principles and Practice of Heterogeneous Catalysis will directly answer some of my questions. Moreso, the research that professor Cargnello oversees on nanomaterials as catalysts is something I find fascinating and well suits my interests. Particularly, the emphasis on shaping the architecture of nanomaterials to observe changes in properties and performance for the benefit of sustainable energy is something I can see myself committing to. I want to explore the theoretical aspects of chemistry and quantum mechanics in regards to screening possible material structures for optimized performance. For example, I would love to investigate heterogeneous catalysts and understand how their structure impacts kinetic and diffusion profiles for reaction systems utilizing carbon dioxide conversion into value-added products and hydrogen generation. 
                 
                <br><br>I believe my experience in materials synthesis, characterization and testing will help me to be successful in this environment. I cemented my foundation for solid-state synthesis techniques and basic characterization techniques when I first joined Dr. Mas Subramanian's research group. I synthesized various solid solutions of perovskites by charge compensating them with different metal ion concentrations and performed diffraction, optical, magnetic and dielectric measurements to elucidate their structure-property relationship. With a fascination for material properties and synthetic protocol, I sought to learn how I could apply my enhanced materials for more real world applications. I joined Dr. David Cann’s Electroceramics Group where I learned the methodical practice of ceramic synthesis and preparation. My project entailed working in collaboration with a company to design a new ceramic material that could be used as a capacitor in cell phones. I synthesized and characterized different ceramics for grain size, low temperature dielectric measurements as well as polarization vs electric field measurements to test for capacitance. This work has led to the discovery of one of the materials I synthesized to have sufficiently high K and low dielectric loss to be further investigated and renewed grant funding for the project from the company.
                
                <br><br>My motivations are heavily driven on conducting research with direct impact for the world; I spent the summer synthesizing and characterizing novel chiral MOFs whilst applying them to separate purer, more pharmaceutically beneficial drugs and utilizing an active MOF catalyst for conversion of carbon dioxide into value added products; the former receiving institutional nomination for the Goldwater Scholarship & Excellence in Education Foundation and the latter earning a first author publication. The current work I lead harnesses encapsulated metal nanoparticles within MOF structures to catalyze carbon dioxide hydrogenation with the aim of reducing plastic pollution.
                 
                <br><br>Never would I have imagined as a freshman that I would still be here and so involved in research. It was not until I took my first graduate level class for inorganic chemistry that I figured it out. This is what I have been looking for: taking stimulating undergraduate and graduate courses in chemical engineering and chemistry, teaching chemistry as a teaching assistant, learning assistant, and Honors College tutor, being so deeply motivated and involved in the research that I do that it invades my dreams; in essence, experiencing what it is like to be a graduate student. Even though it was difficult at times, I loved the work I did and I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life finding ways to benefit the world with chemistry. This along with all of the opportunities I have been given in peer and academic mentorship and support from my colleagues and advisors, I know I want to work in academia as a professor.  I know from the opportunities and research at Stanford that the same sentiment is shared and with hard work, they will help me to succeed in this.
