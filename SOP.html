                 <h1>Statement of Purpose</h1>
                 <p><i> Note: With the entire culmination of
                      one's life experience, it is difficult to confine one's goals and ambitions 
                   in a single page. In this essay, I hope to convey the force that galvanizes my motives.</i>
                   
                  <br><br> My appreciation for education and functional materials began after overcoming homelessness amidst COVID-19 during my freshman year of college. I still remember the countless days Wi-Fi scavenging behind DutchBros to attend school and nights applying for scholarships as an out-of-state student. Although difficult at first, I learned to appreciate tutoring students for free meals and the hard work necessary to earn the luxury of a first-generation education. Strangely, I dedicate my research prospects today to this pandemic which sparked an oath to take every opportunity to learn and explore my interests as much as possible during my undergraduate program.

                  <br><br> Growing up in a city that boasts 100% renewable energy and adopts the forefront in solar energy consumption made me pointedly aware that how we understand sustainable processes determines the trajectory of the global fossil fuel and energy crisis. Since testing nanoporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for gas catalysis in Professor Kyriakos Stylianou’s Materials and Discovery Lab (MaD Lab), I realized I lacked the structural interpretation to explain observed phenomena in heterogeneous catalysts. After two years of optimizing MOF catalyst performance, could I descriptively model how MOF nano-interfaces influenced the charge and mass transport processes that underpin CO2 transformation? Consequently, what are nano interfaces roles in circumventing thermodynamic limits reaction kinetics? It dawned on me that their inherent structural complexity precluded any feasible model for such reactions at the current moment. At graduate school, I intend to investigate the role of transport phenomena in nanoarchitecture to better understand how to design catalytic materials for sustainable energy access.						
                   
                  <br><br>Heterogeneous Catalysis curriculum  will explore some of my inquiries but I look most forward to researching under a professor for catalysis. While taking a graduate Catalysis course at Oregon State University, I initially drew interest in nanotechnology and catalysis research after analyzing a publication modeling monodispersed metal nanoparticles for carbon monoxide oxidation; the size of nanoparticles precisely located on ceria-oxide perimeter active sites influenced reaction thermodynamics of an otherwise, structure independent reaction. From their methods and execution, I know working in a catalysis group focused on nanoarchitecure will be invaluable to the nanostructure research questions I aim to answer and cultivate.
                   
                  <br><br>Research emphasizing on molecular assembly of nanomaterials to observe changes in natural gas catalysis mirrors my current research on optimizing MOFs for carbon dioxide conversion to value-added products. From working with this group, I hope to understand how pore nanoarchitecture and surface interactions of porous catalysts impact kinetic and diffusion profiles for reactions transforming flue gas. Using MOFs or other porous organic frameworks as supports for bimetallic nanoparticles are my first intuition on these matters. Graduate courses such as Selected Topics in Inorganic Chemistry introduced me to synthetic techniques of porous materials, but more importantly, exposed me to the literature on their applications. Seeing how researchers exploit structural functionalities for applications such as photocatalysis and CO2 capture from flue gas, I am reminded that I primarily want to study materials design for a humanitarian cause. This past summer in the MaD Lab, I earned a first-author publication analyzing how active metal sites within isostructural MOFs enhanced carbon dioxide fixation to value-added products. The current project I spearhead researches the design of MOF catalysts to upcycle CO2 and degrade plastics in situ and catalyzed my work harnessing encapsulated metal nanoparticles.
                   
                  <br><br> I recognize reliance on reutilizing greenhouse gasses as energy sources is foundationally unsustainable; the field of photocatalysis, on the other hand, is booming. I am also curious how the dielectric properties of perovskite photovoltaic cells can be tuned through the thoughtful placement of nanoparticles. I joined two other materials research groups at OSU, each honing my foundation in perovskite characterization and preparing me for this environment. Professor Mas Subramanian's solid-state research group first introduced me to solid-state synthesis techniques where I created various perovskite solid solutions of nonstoichiometric compounds. I performed structural and dielectric characterization to elucidate their structure-property relationship, resulting in a material with elevated thermoelectric properties. Afterward, I wondered how a perovskite's electrical properties could be improved under colder temperatures. I joined Professor David Cann’s Electroceramics Group where I worked in collaboration with an international electronics company to design a new temperature-resistant capacitor suitable for cell phones. I co-led in synthesizing and characterizing perovskite-based ceramic composites for grain size, low-temperature dielectric measurements, and polarization vs electric field measurements. One such ceramic I synthesized displayed a sufficiently high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss selected for further experimenting and renewed grant funding for the project.		
                   
                  <br><br>After the pandemic almost ended my college career, I could never be satisfied with doing the bare minimum in college. As a full-time student, I sought opportunities through research and engagement. I worked several jobs teaching chemistry, mentoring freshmen while also serving as an example to my students that even the most daunting of obstacles can be short stepping stones on the path to the next generation of leaders in the scientific community. This philosophy has granted me security and autonomy over my situation now–as a first-generation student, I have overcome homelessness in college, self-funded my degree program today and earned a first-author publication in <i>Catalysis Science & Technology.</i> This is but one reminder that with hard work, I can succeed in my goals; with motivation, I am resolute.
                   
                  <br><br>Today, my undergraduate program is coming to a close, but on my terms. I am excited for the advent of an even higher education where I can inquire about more thought-provoking questions and tackle more challenges that address sustainable energy problems in the world—both abundant in Chemical Engineering. With my experience and education, I intend to proceed in academia as a professor mentoring students and start my own materials discovery laboratory for sustainable energy. With each obstacle and failure I face, I remember every late-night scholarship hunt behind the DutchBros shop that has led me here. The environment at any graduate school will be challenging, but if I may resonate with their scientific profundity, mission values, and contribute some dedicated hard work from myself, I know I will continue to succeed in my goals.
