                 <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>
                 <p>
                 <br><br> The truth is, no one cares about you. You are a burden on everyone. No one enjoys being around you because if they did, you wouldn’t feel so alone. You wouldn’t feel so trapped. The truth is, you need them more than they need you. You need them to fill that emptiness inside of you that your own family never wanted to deal with. That’s why you can’t bear to eat alone or see people drift away because you know it will just bring you back to that dark, dark place you tried so hard to leave behind.

                 <br><br> At most people tolerate you for the time being and so you try to hold on to whatever is left to make you stop remembering what its like to be all alone again. That’s why you hold keepsakes of the people close to you because you know one day they will leave you for the next better thing as soon as it comes and leave you without ever saying goodbye. 
                 
                 <br><br>You feel alone because the people you open up with say you are a burden behind their back. You feel alone because you are trapped in the same walls that you have been all of your life and you see your so called friends doing fun stuff without you, and seeing them happy and free reminds you of that dark place that your parents left you. Everywhere you go you feel trapped. You are screaming on the inside but no one can hear you, begging someone will pull you out of it now and then. They don’t know how deep and dark it goes and they don’t want to know, because if you tell they will just say you are burdening them. They just want to be happy, and happiness does not involve you most of the time.
                 
                 <br><br>This is why you overwork yourself. You try to numb the feeling of rejection, loneliness, and sadness with stress and  busywork, thinking that you can avoid it this way forever. That is why you try to help people and give to people. You think that it will make you feel better about yourself if you help them, and make them think that you are not always a burden. But by doing this, they still would not choose to be around you because they want to, but because you are someone who is easy to benefit them. Because they don’t actually care about who you are as a person.
                 
                 <br><br>They would give you the same thought that you do for other people. Why would they. You are not fun. You do not have that fun spontaneity that real friends have. You are always sad and that dampens their own happiness. You are not interesting. You are broken. A broken piece of garbage that is whats left of what you family discarded. A piece of trash that other people look at and want to give the slightest consideration. That is why they ignore you. You want to do something as simple as hang out, to forget about the pounding voices in the back of you head, and they could not be bothered. 
                 
                 <br><br>You would be better off if you would just hurt yourself. Everyone would be better off if you just killed yourself
