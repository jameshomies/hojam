            <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>
            <p>
            <br><br> The hybrid or "flipped" classroom
            model has been the standard for the teaching team within the chemistry department. Here, students learn the material at home through assigned readings and videos and during class,
            work with other students and the teaching team for in class problems. Since my time here as a teaching assistant (going into my third undergraduate year), 
            I have yet to meet one student out of the 2000+ students in general chemistry who expressed approval of this teaching style.
            <br><br>
            The overarching consensus appears to be the theme "I pay you to teach me in class, not to watch videos and be assigned time-consuming problems".
            Now, my view on this argument is is that really the value of what I can bring to your education? If I ever have the honor and fortune of standing in front of the podium 
            as a professor in teaching a course such as general chemistry, having attained immense knowledge and dedication on the subject, is the value I can bring
            as an educator only limited to spewing out content that a simple google search could answer, or Youtube video could explain just as well? 
            <br><br> The value of an educator is not limited merely based off of what they know, but how their delivery of said knowledge impacts their students. 
            I value doing rather than seeing, and being an active participant in one's education rather than a bystander to a traditional lecture.
            Knowledge is ineffectual if it cannot be applied, and so I value systematic guided approach to problem solving. Rather than give clues on how to approach a problem,
            I ask them what they wrote in their notes based off the last lecture and see if they can draw any parallels to the problem. I seldom respond to any direct questions, instead,
            I prefer to respond with my own question to stimulate critical thinking and overaching understanding of game plan.
            
            <br><br>
            The goal to solving a problem is to not get 
            the right answer -if you always get the right answer, you are not learning. The goal is to train yourself to think critically and understand the process, and to approach a problem
            on your own using recall of course content as a supplement. The value of an educator is to not simply lecture and provide answers witin the lectures; 
            it is not the content they provide either; it is their ability to prepare students to engage in problems that will challenge them, and stimulate
            their fight or flight response in approaching a problem. It is their ability to walk with them and acclimate them to being 
            self-active in their education.
