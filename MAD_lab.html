      <p> Metal-organic frameworks are so names as they are a structure or framework of a series of
        atoms consisting of metals and organic material. The metal atom is the center of this framework and it bears organic
        attachments, or ligands, around them. In coordination chemistry, these ligands attach to other metal centers, thus
        forming this network of metal ion clusters to coordinated organic ligands. These structures form the paradign unit
        cell which gives rise to extremely porous material. As these frameworks extend two or three-dimensional space, MOFs are
        particularly useful with their tunable surface areas and functionalities.<br><br>
         My research explores understanding pore-architecture toward
      rational design of MOF catalysts, particularly towards CO2 and sustainability efforts. I employ reactions that utilize MOF catalyts to transform CO2 to value added products such as 
        cyclic carbonates and methanol. My research also investigates designing homochiral MOFs toward 
    enantioselective separation of eutomer and distomer drugs. Our findings in this area allow us to explore homochiral MOF materials as asymmetric catalysts for stereoselective reactions governing carbon dioxide transformation.  </p><br><br>

    <p>ABSTRACT: The formation of value-added cyclic carbonates by the cycloaddition of CO2 to various epoxides is investigated using a ruthenium-based metal-organic framework (Ru-HKUST-1). The Ru-HKUST-1 catalyst demonstrates catalytic activity for CO2 fixation with a high substrate concentration under mild conditions, and is shown to be more active than the traditional Cu-HKUST-1.

      <p> ABSTRACT: Pharmaceutical research places great importance on the stereochemistry and enantioseparation of racemic drugs due to the potential variations in pharmacological and toxicological properties displayed by different enantiomers as they interact with the body’s metabolic pathway. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous adsorbents that can be designed to possess homochirality within their structures, enabling tunable porosity and enantioselective adsorption. In our study, we present the synthesis of five novel and homochiral Co-L-GG(R) MOFs (where L-GG = glycyl-L(S)-glutamic acid and R = bipyridyl (bipy) pillar ligands). These isoreticular MOFs were synthesized using the ligand extension strategy. This approach allowed us to systematically control the pore sizes of the MOFs, enabling fine-tuning of the enantioselective adsorption of racemic drugs, primarily DL-Penicillamine (Pen). Our findings reveal that the pore size greatly influences enantioselective adsorption, where too large or too small pores hinder the proximity-driven dispersive interactions between the drug and the pore surface, resulting in poor enantioselective adsorption of Pen.  </p>

    The need for enantiopure materials and better methods to obtain pure material is growing the discovery of new drugs is rapidly expanding. 
    Current methods use tedious separation methods for enantioseparation once a racmic product is received, but with the recent science or 
    asymmetric organocatalysis, an enantiopure product may be obtain during synthesis. The key to this is using a catalyst with asymmetric or chiral centers.
    Metal-organic frameworks can be intuitively designed using chiral organic linkers to exhibit chiral reconition sites which can bind to chiral subtrates 
    that reflect same polarized light (R or S). The product that may be collected in the solution is thus the opposite configuration. Here I intend to
    use the same homorchiral isoreticular MOFs used in my drug separation project to see how 1) they serve as catalyst to efficiently produce a product and 2)
    their enantioselectivities and catalytic activity are related to the pore aperatues of these reticular structures. More to come! </p>

    <p>
    Polyethylene Terephalate (PET) is the plastic found in single-use water bottles and one of the main contributors to plastic pollution.
    It takes around 450 years for the material to completely degrade on its own, and so finding way to reuse the material is of importance for 
    a sustainable environment. Similarly, carbon dioxide emissions have increased over the last century contributing to global warming, and finding ways to repurpose carbon dioxide
    into value-added products is also a high priority. 
    <br><br> 
    In this project, I aim to transform both PET and carbon dioxide into value added products <i>in situ</i> using a Metal-Organic Framework nanocomposite.
    I am interested in a catalyst with dual functions: to effectively catalyze carbon dioxide and hydrogen in methanol, and effectively utilize the methanol
    in a methanolysis reaction to degrade PET into value added products. Stay tuned for more! </p>s
