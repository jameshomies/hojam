                 <h1>Hi, I'm James</h1>
                         
<p>Here's a little bit about me:
  <br><br>
  I grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada, where I lived until my adulthood. I went to Silverado High School and graduated top of my class with Advanced Honors. I later moved to Corvallis where I attended and graduated Magna Cum Laude from <b>Oregon State University</b> (OSU) with an Honors B.S. in Chemical Engineering.
  <br><br>
  As an out-of-state student, I initially faced a challenge very similar to many college students: not having enough to afford college. When I first arrived in OSU, I had less than two-hundred dollars and so I worked full-time to make ends meet while dual-enrolled in Linn Benton Community College and OSU. When COVID-19 emerged and the nation went into lockdown, a lot of my problems exacerbated. Like many others, I lost my job, my friends and family, and lastly my home. I spent that pandemic housing and food insecure meet while still attending classes virtually from various coffee shops. Through various outreach, support from friends and advisors, and hard work for financial independence and obtaining scholarships, I self-funded my first-generation education. During that time I found my inner resolve to pull myself out of that situation and come out more determined than I ever was before. From this determination, I discovered many things about myself during my undergraduate program, including what I was interested in.
  <br><br>
  My sophomore year of college, I found my passion for two things: climbing and chemistry. That year, I was offered three amazing opportunities in education: becoming a Resident Assistant for Hawley-Buxton, a Learning Assistant for calculus, and a Teaching Assistant for general chemistry. In the engineering dorm, most engineering students are required to take calculus and chemistry and so I had the opportunity to not only help instruct in the classroom, but outside of class as well with my residents. I constructed worksheets, formed study groups, and encouraged my residents to succeed in their studies, specifically chemistry. As a TA for chemistry, I regularly interacted with chemistry professors, graduate students and faculty. Their work inspired me to conduct research within materials chemistry. I joined 3 research groups within material science/chemistry and have joined the Honors College to be more involved in research.
  
  I still am involved in teaching, as a teaching assistant and learning assistant, and I am now the Honors College Chemistry tutor. I have also become a learning assistant for chemical engineering curriculum and participated in many STEM outreach activities for underserved K-12 student. By graduation, I was named the <b>2023 Erik Muehlenkamp Memorial Leadership Award</b> for my service within education. With my practice in pedagogy and time spent in residential education as a Resident Assistant, I am certain of one thing: my main motivation each day is the ability to learn about chemistry and connect with people meaningfully through education and mentorship. 
  <br><br>
  I am now a Ph.D. student at <b>Northwestern University</b>, leveraging nanophotonics and electrochemistry to expand the fields of material science and chemical engineering . My research interests seek to understand how structure-property relationships of different materials influence charge transport phenomena toward applications of sustainable energy, catalysis, and solar fuels.  During my time at Northwestern, my goal is to learn as much as I can about chemical and materials engineering, and to continue teaching in academia as a professor. I am hoping during my time at Northwestern university, I can integrate inclusivity and collaborative learning into the core chemical engineering curriculum and promote STEM outreach events to underserved communities in Illinois.
