              <p> 
                I first began researching materials design in 2021 my sophomore year at OSU in the Subramanian Group under Professor Mas Subramanian to study perovskite electronics. While they are the most photoactive solar cells, lead-containing perovskites pose as potential carcinogens. With this in mind, my goal was to study the structure-property relationships of cation-substituted ABO3 perovskites and A2(BB’)O6 double perovskites toward designing new high-performance lead-free semi-conductor materials. I performed solid-state synthesis, charge-compensating oxidized B-site metals with different transition metals to create perovskites of different electronic structures. I learned how to characterize diffraction, dielectric, and absorbance properties at varying non-stoichiometric charge occupancies and temperatures. With my findings, I could create thermoelectric structure-property relationships that were essential to my graduate student mentor’s Ph.D. dissertation defense, who passed and graduated this past summer. Our findings on novel perovskite structures with enhanced thermoelectric properties at elevated temperatures are currently being drafted for publication where I will be second author.

                <p>  I researched creating novel Metal
                  Organic Frameworks (MOFs) under Dr. Kyriakos Stylianou to identify MOFs with unique functionalities applicable to real-world
                  uses, such as gas capture, catalysis, photocatalysis, sensing and separation. My interests revolve around developing novel chiral MOFs
                  for enantioselective separation of drugs and for asymmetric catalysis, as well as using MOFs for carbon dioxide catalysis into value-added products. 
                  I am currently leading the research on these within the lab, check out more about them under Research Projects!

                <p>I joined Professor David Cann’s Electroceramics Group at OSU during my junior year in 2021 under a year-long collaboration with an international electronics company to create a temperature-ranging ceramic capacitor to be used in cell phones. Using the solid-state synthesis techniques I had learned from the Subramanian Group, I made lanthanide-based ceramic perovskites at non-stoichiometric occupancies to elucidate their low-temperature dielectric properties. In both groups, I honed my crystallography skills and understanding of how structure affected electronic properties.

                  Before midterms and final exams, I would create practice test and review sheets and host review sessions beforehand. Honors College advisors would
