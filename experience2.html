                <p>In inorganic chemistry, we make use of the transition metals shown on the periodic table. When it comes to synthesis
                    using these metals, it is pertinent to have the theory behind the bonding that comes in consideration for metals. Most
                    transition metals have several oxidation states and depending on these oxidation states, affects the number of valence
                    electrons, thus affecting their low-high spin complex when they bond. It is the arrangement of electrons and their
                    differing energy level in metals that rises to certain properties like ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism and
                    color. It is important to know that each metal has its own unique properties, from conductivity, toxicity, and
                    oxidation sensitivity that gives these synthesized metals their own characterisics. We aim to utilize the transition
                    metals and their unique properties to design material that best incorporates them into real-world applications.

                  was recognized by the Honors College. They asked me to formally become the Honors College Chemistry Tutor and so my platform increased
                  beyond the dormitories. I ran a Discord server within the Honors community and posted weekly review sheets based on the lecture content that week.
                  Before midterms and final exams, I would create practice test and review sheets and host review sessions beforehand. Honors College advisors would
                  direct students to me for one-on-one tutoring.

                      taught the lab sections, totaling over 100 students and held office hours via the Mole Hole every week. I attended weekly staff meetings for the chemistry lecture as well as the lab along the graduate students to better prepare students the following week. In addition, I
                      wrote review sheets and other study material for students, as well as hosted review session within my dorm with my

<p>Originally, I was a resident at Cauthorn hall during my freshman year. I had the opportunity to become the youngest Resident Assistant by being an RA at the ILLC for the summer term of 2020. I later went on to Hawley/Buxton, the engineering dorm, to
be the Resident Assistant for the 2020-2021 academic year before returning to the ILLC the following summer. This upcoming
academic year, I will be the RA in Sackett Hall, which is one of the Honors College Dorms. In my culmination of within
residential education, I will have worked with over five hundred students in the dormitories where I offer resources for
incoming college student, facillitate safe and encouraging academic learning envrionments, host community events,
put up bulletin boards, and deal with crisis management situations. During my time as an RA, I have personally led and instructed residents in chemistry class by making worksheets and hosting group study sessions. During my first year in Residential Education, I was awarded the end of the year Dianne Finklein Memorial Scholarhip. </p>
