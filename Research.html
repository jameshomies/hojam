<p>In the Subramanian Research Group, we focus on solid-state synthesis for the purpose of creating novel inorganic
  solid-state functional materials. These materials of interest can be used and are characterized for their properties
  in electronics, conducitivty, magnetic potential, dielectric and thermoelectric, and high performance color pigments.
  Dr. Mas Subramanian is Milton Harris Chair of Material Science and the PI at the time the novel blue pigment, known as YInMn Blue or Oregon Blue, first surfaced from his labortaory. Since then, pigments and their performance has
  been a notable emphasis in the Subramanian Research Group. </p>

<p>In inorganic chemistry, we make use of the transition metals shown on the periodic table. When it comes to synthesis
  using these metals, it is pertinent to have the theory behind the bonding that comes in consideration for metals. Most
  transition metals have several oxidation states and depending on these oxidation states, affects the number of valence
  electrons, thus affecting their low-high spin complex when they bond. It is the arrangement of electrons and their
  differing energy level in metals that rises to certain properties like ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism and
  color. It is important to know that each metal has its own unique properties, from conductivity, toxicity, and
  oxidation sensitivity that gives these synthesized metals their own characterisics. We aim to utilize the transition
  metals and their unique properties to design material that best incorporates them into real-world application </p>
<br>
<p> in this group, I assist a graduate student on their project of creating novel double perovskites for properties
  characterization. Perovskties have a general formula ABX3, and have the same type of crystal structure of calcium
  titanate oxide (CaTiO3). A double pervoskite has a structure when half of the "B" site cations of the structure is
  replaced by another "B" cation, so would have the structure A2BB'X6. In this project, we replace certain coordinated
  atoms of a previously researched double pervoskite with more economical and less hazardous chemicals for their
  characterization. More updates to come! </p>

<p>In the Materials and Discovery Lab (MaD Lab) we make use of the growing up and coming material: Metal-Organic
  Frameworks (MOFs). MOFs have been seeing increasing applications and have piqued the interest of numerous chemists,
  inorgnic and organic, material scientists and chemical engineers. Over the last few decades, MOFs have been in the
  forefront of research for their myriad of applications. The coordinator of the MaD lab is Dr. Kyriakos Stylianou, an
  assistant professor at Oregon State University who has spent the bulk of his research studying on MOFs and their
  applications to real world scenarios</p>
<br>
<p> Metal-organic frameworks are so named because that is exactly what they are: a structure or framework of a series of
  atoms consisting of metals and organic material. The metal atom is the center of this framework and it bears organic
  attachments, or ligands, around them. In coordination chemistry, these ligands attach to other metal centers, thus
  forming this network of metal ion clusters to coordinated organic ligands. These structures form the paradign unit
  cell which gives rise to extremely porous material. As these frameworks form three dimensional space, MOFs are
  particularly useful in their taking advantage of such surface area. For example, some MOF material have shown surface
  areas of over six-thousand square meters per gram. With more surface area, the more storage that is possible for gasses as they
  preferentially bind themselves to the surface of any container that is in. This is why MOFs have been seeing
  increasing application in the methane gas storage. In the MaD lab, we synthesize new MOFs with the purpose of
  utilizing some of their other uses, such as gas capture and storage, cataysis and photocatalysis, sensing and
  detection or specific analytes, and separation. </p>

  <p> In the MaD lab, my research interest revolves around using metal-organic frameworks for drug separation on the basis
    of enantioselectivity. The majority of organic compounds, including drugs, exist in nature as what are known as
    enantiomers. Enantiomers are compounds that have the same structural formula, but have different 3D configurations in
    space. They are non-superimposable mirror images due to having chirality among at least one of its carbon
    centers. Enantiomers are separated by R and S configurations, and while they bear the same formula, it is because of
    the way it is configured that can give different properties and have different effects. For example the human nose has
    thousands of olfactory receptors that binds to organic compounds to smell. Each receptor corresponds to different
    smells, and the oganic compound, limonene, exists in R and S configuration. In the nose, their are receptors that only
    bind to R or S, and so (R)-limonene smells like oranges and (S)-limonene smells like lemons. The same thing happens in
    biological systems in that different configurations operate under different metabolic pathways and thus have differing
    effect. Most chiral drugs today are produced in a racemic mixture, or 1:1 ratio of the R and S molecule. In the 1960s,
    Thalidomide was a drug used to treat morning sickness for pregnant woman. It was later discovered that (R)-thalidomde
    is used for morning sickness but (S)-thalidomide caused birth defects. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Enantioseparation of racemics is a quintissential study in pharmoceuticals and is the basis of my research. In my
      research, I aim to use chiral MOFs for chiral separation of chiral drugs on the basis of such enantiomers. In
      my first separation project, I aim to use pillar ligands to tune the pore size of homochiral peptide-based MOFs.
      Peptides are chains of amino acids, and when coordinated to certain metals, can create 1D ladder-like structures. By
      using longer ligands of differing lengths and functionalities, the distance or pore aperature between these ladders will
      increase, allowing for separation of larger racemic molecules which can be evaluated for enantiomeric excess. More
      update on my project to come! </p>
